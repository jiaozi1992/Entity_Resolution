# Entity_Resolution

Entity_Resolution compares different feature selection methods and clustering models in entity linking problem and provides prediction for matched items from two files.

## Usage1: compares different feature selection methods and clustering models in entity linking problem

### Part 1, generate the pairwise features file.
Example Usage

$ python myCalSim.py ./dataset/test1.csv ./dataset/test2.csv -o ./test -f name

Full Command List
The full list of command line options is available with $ python myCalSim.py -h

#### 1,./dataset/test1.csv ./dataset/test2.csv
The input files should be in .csv format with column names as the header. The two files should have same schema(same column name and order). The first column should be record id(int) and the second column should be class id, which "class" means the record belong to. Id should be integers and any id from one file must be larger than all ids from another file.

#### 2, -o ./outputName
It will output a pairwise features file with the outputName. The row of the pairwise feature file will be a potential pair from the two different data sources and the features of the pair. The features are generated by string similarity functions.

#### 3, -f name
It is to clarify the column you want to use for jaccard blocking. Enter the column name of which the value you want to use for blocking. If none, the third column will be used for blocking.

### Part 2, compares different feature selection methods and clustering model for clustering.
Example Usage

$ python model_part.py ./dataset/test1.csv ./dataset/test2.csv ./test -o ./res -f Random -m RandomForest

Full Command List
The full list of command line options is available with $ python model_part.py -h

#### 1, ./dataset/test1.csv ./dataset/test2.csv
The same two files with part 1

#### 2,./test
The pairwise feature file from part 1.

#### 3, -o <outputFile>
OutputFile will contain Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F-measure for different thresholds of probability(being the matched pairs). Thresholds are from 0.0 to 1.0(0.1 as unit of measurement). Besides,the distribution of thresholds in the output file will follow the distribution of probabilities in predictions.

#### 4,-f <featureSelectionModel>
featureSelectionModel Option: Complete, Random, VarianceThreshold,SelectKBestFeatures,SelectFromModel_LassoCV. If none, Complete will be used.

#### 5, -m <clusterModel>
clusterModel Option: LogisticRegressionCV, RandomForest. If none, RandomForest model will be used.


## Usage2: Predict items cluster in two files(Matched items will have the same cluster name).

### Part 1, generate the pairwise features file.
Example Usage

$ python myCalSim.py ./dataset/test3.csv ./dataset/test4.csv -o ./test -f name
#### 1,./dataset/test3.csv ./dataset/test4.csv
The input files should fulfil the requirements of the part1 in Usage1. Part of the items should be labeled with cluster name whatever you like and matched rows should have the same cluster name. 'class' column of unlabeled rows should be blank.

Full Command List
The full list of command line options is available with $ python myCalSim.py -h

### Part 2, predict the cluster with part of the file label.
Example Usage
$ python predict.py ./dataset/test3.csv ./dataset/test4.csv ./test -a ./tst1 -b ./tst2 -f Complete -m RandomForest

Full Command List
The full list of command line options is available with $ python model_part.py -h

#### 1, ./dataset/test1.csv ./dataset/test2.csv
The same two files with part 1. The schema of the two files must fulfill the requirements in part1.

#### 2, ./test
The pairwise feature file from part 1.

#### 3, -a ./tst1 -b ./tst2
The output predicted file for test1.csv and test2.csv.

#### 4, -f Complete
featureSelectionModel Option: Complete, Random, VarianceThreshold,SelectKBestFeatures,SelectFromModel_LassoCV. If none, Complete will be used.

#### 5, -m <clusterModel>
clusterModel Option: LogisticRegressionCV, RandomForest. If none, RandomForest model will be used.
